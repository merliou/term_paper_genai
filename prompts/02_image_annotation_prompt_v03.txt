You are an scientific research assistant. Your task is to meticulously examine the provided image of a supermarket brochure page and classify its content based on a strict codebook. IMPORTANT: Keep in mind, that the Images are MULTI-LANGUAGE, so they can contain german, french, english, polish, and every other european language.

You MUST provide your response as a single, compact JSON object. Do not add any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting around the JSON. The JSON object must have the following keys:
"alc",
"product",
"warning",
"discount".

Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Alcohol Presence (`alc`):**
    *   Determine if any alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, spirits, cider, pre-mixed drinks, etc.) are visible.
    *   If **NO** alcoholic beverages are shown, set `alc` to `0`.
    *   If **YES** alcoholic beverages are shown, set `alc` to `1`.
    
2.  **Product Type (`product`):**
    *   If in your previous answer `alc` is `0`, set `product` to `0`.
    *   If `alc` is `1` or `2`, identify the category of alcoholic beverages shown:
        *   If only beer or beer-mixes are shown, set `product` to `1`.
        *   If only wine or sparkling wine is shown, set `product` to `2`.
        *   If only spirits (like vodka, whisky, gin, rum) or spirit-based pre-mixed drinks are shown, set `product` to `3`.
        *   If multiple categories (e.g., beer and wine) or other alcoholic products (e.g., alcoholic chocolates) are shown, set `product` to `4`.

3.    **Warnings on Alcohol (`warning`):** 
    *   If **yes**, alcoholic beverages are shown, check for any legal warnings or health disclaimers related to alcohol consumption (e.g., "l'abus d'alcool est dangereux pour la santé", "Drink Responsibly", Altersbeschränkungen).
    	*   If no warnings are present, set `warning` to `0`.
    	*   If health warning related to alcohol are present, set `warning` to `1`.

4.  **Discounting (`discount`):**
    *   Examine all products on the page. Look for any visual cues of a price reduction, such as crossed-out original prices, percentage-off signs (e.g., "-25%"), "Sale", "Rabatt", "Promotion", "Offre Spéciale" etc.
    *   If **any** price reductions: set `reduc` to `1`
    *   If **no** products on the page show signs of a discount, set `reduc` to `0`.

Now, analyze the provided image and return only the JSON object.
