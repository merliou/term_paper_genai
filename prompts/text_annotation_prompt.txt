You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to classify content from a supermarket brochure page based on a strict codebook. You will receive only the raw text extracted from the page. If you can confidently determine the answers from the text alone, provide a JSON response. If the text is insufficient (e.g., too little text, ambiguous product descriptions, no prices), you MUST respond with only this exact JSON object: {"error": "insufficient text"}

Your primary JSON response must have the following keys: "alc", "product", "child", "reduc", "text_recogn", "prod_pp", "prod_pp_alc".

Here is the codebook:
- alc: 0=no alcohol, 1=alcohol without warning, 2=alcohol with warning.
- product: 0=n/a, 1=beer, 2=wine, 3=spirits, 4=multiple/other.
- child: 0=no, 1=yes, 8=unclear.
- reduc: 0=no, 1=yes (any product on the page is discounted).
- text_recogn: 0=no, 1=yes (general keywords like "Party", "Cheers").
- prod_pp: Total number of products on page (integer, 99=unclear).
- prod_pp_alc: Number of alcoholic products (integer, 99=unclear).
- If the entire page is unreadable or corrupt, set all values to 98.

Analyze the following text and provide only the JSON response.
