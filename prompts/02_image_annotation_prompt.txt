You are an scientific research assistant. Your task is to meticulously examine the provided image of a supermarket brochure page and classify its content based on a strict codebook.

You MUST provide your response as a single, compact JSON object. Do not add any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting around the JSON. The JSON object must have the following keys: "alc", "product", "child", "reduc", "prod_pp", "prod_pp_alc".

Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Alcohol Presence (`alc`):**
    *   First, determine if any alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, spirits, cider, pre-mixed drinks, etc.) are explicitly shown for sale.
    *   If **no** alcoholic beverages are shown, set `alc` to `0`.
    *   If **yes**, alcoholic beverages are shown, check for any legal warnings or health disclaimers related to alcohol consumption (e.g., "l'abus d'alcool est dangereux pour la santé", "Drink Responsibly", Altersbeschränkungen).
    *   If health warning related to alcohol are present, set `alc` to `2`.
    *   If no warnings are present, set `alc` to `1`.

2.  **Product Type (`product`):**
    *   If `alc` is `0`, set `product` to `0`.
    *   If `alc` is `1` or `2`, identify the category of alcoholic beverages shown:
        *   If only beer or beer-mixes are shown, set `product` to `1`.
        *   If only wine or sparkling wine is shown, set `product` to `2`.
        *   If only spirits (like vodka, whisky, gin, rum) or spirit-based pre-mixed drinks are shown, set `product` to `3`.
        *   If multiple categories (e.g., beer and wine) or other types (e.g., cider, specialty liqueurs) are shown, set `product` to `4`.

3.  **Discounting (`reduc`):**
    *   Examine all products on the page. Look for any visual cues of a price reduction, such as crossed-out original prices, percentage-off signs (e.g., "-25%"), "Sale", "Rabatt", "Promotion", "Offre Spéciale" etc.
    *   If **any** price reductions: set `reduc` to `1`
    *   If **no** products on the page show signs of a discount, set `reduc` to `0`.

4.  **Product Count per Page (`prod_pp`):**
    *   Count the total number of distinct, individual products offered for sale on the entire page. A multi-pack (e.g., a six-pack of milk) counts as one product.
    *   Set `prod_pp` to this integer count.
    *   If it is impossible to determine a clear number, set `prod_pp` to `99`.

5.  **Alcohol Product Count (`prod_pp_alc`):**
    *   If `alc` is `0`, set `prod_pp_alc` to `0`.
    *   If `alc` is `1` or `2`, count only the number of distinct alcoholic products on the page.
    *   Set `prod_pp_alc` to this integer count.
    *   If it is impossible to determine a clear number (but alcohol is present), set `prod_pp_alc` to `99`.
